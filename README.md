# unilang

unilang is a (personal) list of useful (and less useful) programming languages I came across during my Computer Science studies at the universtiy of basel. The list is Work in Progress, as it gets expanded more and more.

## Introduction

The following section is an introdcution to `unilang`:

### Acknowledgement

During the study of Computer Science, students often have to learn a single (or multiple) programming language. The temptation to only use this single language is very high.
The following list is made to broaden the horizon on this subject.
The list aims not on being super comprehensive, it is a representation of my personal opinion / experience.
Besides the simple listing of different languages, I also share tools, IDEs, resources, and other useful information.

### Contributions

Do you not agree with my opinion, or do you use / know an other language / additional resources or any useful thing else? Create a pull-request and maybe I will add your additions into this list. Otherwise you are welcome to maintain your own list (on a different branch or in your own fork of this list).

## Text

Textual work, write-ups, and other forms of texts form a big part of university life.
This is why a good toolbox of text-related languages is important.

### LaTeX

Let's, be honest: LaTeX rules the world!
I am a big fan of latex and I can only recommend it for your academic write-ups.

https://www.latex-project.org/

**Tools:**

* I personally use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) and am happy with it.
* The Tex distribution I use is [MikTex](https://miktex.org/)

### Markdown

As short, non-formatted texts are easy and quickly written, more often than not, you want to add a super tiny bit of formatting to it. Either you would like to highlight code fragments, or emphase a word, or even structure your document into sections. 

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is your friend. Especially in the community of wikis or online git repository providers, markdown is omnipresent.

This particular document is written in markdown, using the [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor) WYSIWYG editor.

**Tools:**

* [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor)
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a universal command line document converter

##Editors

 * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for all the windows users out there
 * [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) for unix users
 * [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for the OSX users out there, I did actually not use this on my own, but was told about it

## Programming

The following programming languages I stumbled upon, once or twice.

### Java

Studying Computer Science at the University of Basel, students learn Java in the very first CS course. The follow-up course, in the second semester, is about writing a multiplayer game in Java, applying server-client architecture.

**Tools:**

* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) I used to use eclipse as IDE for four years, but then I switched to
* [InelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), a truly great IDE

**Resources:**

* [Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/), the API reference documentation
* [The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/), very good and step-by-step tutorials (basically, if you want to know something, go there)
* [Awesome Java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java), an awesome list about useful Java resources and, especially, libraries

### Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is actually not a language, you have to learn during your studies, since it does not occur in any course as a mandatory language. Nevertheless, I really recommend koltin, since I would call it a moden version of Java; It feels java-ish to write Kotlin, it is run in a JVM and you can still leverage the complete java-ecosystem, if you want to.
